# Getting Started

Get set up locally in two steps:

### Environment Variables

Replace the values in **.env.example** with your values and rename this file to **.env**:

* `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of your application; should be `app.py`.
* `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which to run your application; either `development` or `production`.
* `SECRET_KEY`: Randomly generated string of characters used to encrypt your app's data.
* `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: SQLAlchemy connection URI to a SQL database.

*Remember never to commit secrets saved in .env files to Github.*
